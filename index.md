# **Top 10 Emojis in My LinkedIn Feed: A Python Data Analysis Tutorial**
## **Introduction: Why Emoji Analysis Matters**


In today's digital communication landscape, emojis have become a universal language that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers. LinkedIn, traditionally seen as a professional networking platform, has increasingly embraced emoji usage as professionals seek to add personality and emotion to their posts. But which emojis dominate professional discourse?

This tutorial will guide you through collecting LinkedIn post data, extracting emojis using Python's regex capabilities, and visualizing the most popular emojis in your feed. You'll learn practical skills in **text processing, data manipulation with pandas, and data visualization**—all essential tools for any data scientist's toolkit.

## **What You'll Learn**
By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Extract emojis from text using Unicode regex patterns
- Handle CSV data with pandas
- Count and rank emoji frequencies
- Create compelling visualizations of text data

## **Prerequisites and Setup**
Before we dive in, make sure you have these Python libraries installed:


```python
!pip install pandas regex matplotlib
```

    Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (2.2.2)

    Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.8.2->pandas) (1.17.0)
    

**Note**: We're using the `regex` library (not the built-in `re`) because it provides better Unicode support for emoji detection.
## **Step 1: Import Required Libraries**
Let's start by importing the essential libraries for our analysis:


```python
import io, requests, unicodedata
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import regex as re
from collections import Counter
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetImage, AnnotationBbox
import logging, warnings
logging.getLogger('matplotlib.font_manager').setLevel(logging.ERROR)
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message=r"Glyph .* missing from font", category=UserWarning)
```

## **Step 2: Understanding Emoji Detection**
Detecting emojis in text isn't straightforward because emojis are complex Unicode characters. Some emojis are single characters, while others are combinations of multiple Unicode points. Here's our robust emoji detection function:


```python
def is_real_emoji(cluster: str) -> bool:
    """
    Determines if a Unicode grapheme cluster contains a real emoji.
    Uses Unicode property classes to identify emoji presentation forms.
    """
    return bool(re.search(
        r'\p{Emoji_Presentation}|\uFE0F|\u200D|\p{Extended_Pictographic}',
        cluster
    ))

def extract_emojis_all(text: str):
    """
    Extracts all emojis from a given text string.
    Returns a list of emoji characters found.
    """
    clusters = re.findall(r'\X', str(text))
    return [cluster for cluster in clusters if is_real_emoji(cluster)]
```

**Understanding the Regex Pattern**  
| Pattern Component            | Meaning                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `\p{Emoji_Presentation}`    | Characters with emoji presentation by default  |
| `\uFE0F`                     | Variation Selector-16 (forces emoji style)     |
| `\u200D`                     | Zero-Width Joiner (combines emoji sequences)   |
| `\p{Extended_Pictographic}` | Extended pictographic characters               |


## **Step 3: Load and Process Your Data**
Assuming you have a CSV file with LinkedIn post data, load it and extract emojis:


```python
df = pd.read_csv("imoji_data.csv")

df["emojis"] = df["post_text"].apply(extract_emojis_all)

all_emojis = [emoji for emoji_list in df["emojis"] for emoji in emoji_list]

emoji_counts = Counter(all_emojis)
print(f"Total emojis found: {len(all_emojis)}")
print(f"Unique emojis: {len(emoji_counts)}")
```

    Total emojis found: 162
    Unique emojis: 90
    

## **Step 4: Identify Top 10 Emojis**
Now let's find the most popular emojis in your data:


```python
top_10_emojis = emoji_counts.most_common(10)
df_top10 = pd.DataFrame(top_10_emojis, columns=["Emoji", "Count"])

print("Top 10 Emojis in LinkedIn Feed:")
print("=" * 35)
print(df_top10.to_markdown(index=False))
```

    Top 10 Emojis in LinkedIn Feed:
    ===================================
    | Emoji   |   Count |
    |:--------|--------:|
    | 🚀      |      11 |

## **Step 5: Create a Compelling Visualization**
Transform your emoji data into an eye-catching bar chart:


```python
def emoji_to_codepoints(e: str) -> str:
    cps = []
    for ch in e:
        cp = ord(ch)
        if cp in (0xFE0F, 0xFE0E):
            continue
        cps.append(f"{cp:x}")
    return "-".join(cps)

def load_twemoji_png(emoji: str):
    code = emoji_to_codepoints(emoji)
    url = f"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/14.0.2/72x72/{code}.png"
    r = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
    r.raise_for_status()
    return plt.imread(io.BytesIO(r.content), format="png")

emojis = ['🚀','👉','✨','👇','✅','♻️','💡','🎉','⚡','🎯']
counts = [11, 9, 6, 6, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
bars = ax.bar(range(len(emojis)), counts,
              color=['#FF6B6B','#4ECDC4','#45B7D1','#96CEB4','#FECA57',
                     '#FF9FF3','#54A0FF','#5F27CD','#00D2D3','#FF9F43'])

ax.set_title('Top 10 Emojis in My LinkedIn Feed', fontsize=22, fontweight='bold', pad=18)
ax.set_xlabel('Emojis', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')

for bar in bars:
    h = bar.get_height()
    ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., h + 0.25, f'{int(h)}',
            ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=12, fontweight='bold')

for x, e in enumerate(emojis):
    img = load_twemoji_png(e)
    ab = AnnotationBbox(OffsetImage(img, zoom=0.55),
                        (x, -0.08),
                        frameon=False,
                        xycoords=('data', 'axes fraction'),
                        box_alignment=(0.5, 1.0))

## **Extending This Analysis**
Want to take the emoji analysis further? Consider these enhancements:

- 1. **Temporal trends**: Track how emoji usage changes during business hours vs. weekends
- 2. **Engagement correlation**: Compare emoji frequency with likes, comments, and shares
- 3. **Industry-specific patterns**: Analyze emoji preferences across tech, finance, healthcare, etc.
- 4. **Content type analysis**: Compare emoji usage in original posts vs. shared content


## **Troubleshooting Common Issues (Afterthoughts on Data Collection)**

## **1. Sample Size Evolution**

- I began with **30 posts**. This was enough to test my pipeline quickly, but the distribution looked unstable, and a single emoji could dominate.
- Expanding to **60 posts** made the top emojis rank more consistently.
- Finally, at **70 posts**, the pattern stabilized, and I gained more confidence in the results.

👉 **Learning point**: as the sample size increases, the estimated frequencies converge and stabilize—an illustration of fundamental sampling principles.

## **2. Data Collection Criteria**
While scrolling LinkedIn, I noticed some posts repeated the **same emoji multiple times**:

- Example: `"Congrats!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉"`

If I counted every occurrence, one post could skew the results badly—essentially becoming an **outlier**.

**My decision**: count each emoji at most **once per post**.

- Rationale: I wanted to capture whether an emoji was used in a post, not how many times the author smashed it.

- Note: depending on the research question, another analyst might reasonably choose to count all instances.

## **3. Statistical Takeaways**
- **Representativeness matters**: small samples are vulnerable to distortion by a single extreme post.

- **Sample size effect**: larger \( n \) smooths out fluctuations and yields more reliable proportions.

- **Operational definitions**: setting clear, consistent counting rules (e.g., repeated emojis per post) is essential for reproducibility.

## **4. Relative Frequency (Percentages)**
Raw counts are helpful, but percentages let us compare usage more intuitively across samples or networks.

Formula:

$$
f(x) = \frac{\text{count of emoji } x}{\text{total emoji count}}
$$

Example:

- If the top emoji 🚀 appears 11 times in a dataset of 70 total emojis:

$$
f(\text{🚀}) = \frac{11}{70} \approx 0.157
$$

So about **15.7%** of all emojis in my sample were 🚀, signaling its strong association with LinkedIn's “growth/innovation” vibe.
