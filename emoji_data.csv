I’m sincerely grateful to everyone who welcomed me warmly and generously supported me throughout the whole journey! I would like to give special thanks to my managers for their thoughtful guidance during my internship, and also to my teammates who patiently answered all my endless questions from the seat right next to me. Thanks to you all, I was able to adapt quickly and learn so much more during my internship.🙇🏻‍♀️ What made this experience even more special was having the opportunity to work on quality assurance for a large-scale service with over 10 million DAU. It allowed me to think from the user’s perspective about how to deliver better experiences, and to be directly involved in the entire journey of a product. Though the time was short, I’ll always carry the valuable experiences and connections I gained here, and I’ll contine striving to grow further in the future!💫"
